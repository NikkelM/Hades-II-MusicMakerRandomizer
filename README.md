# Randomize Music Maker Song Choice

This mod adds a new song to the Music Maker, which will play a random unlocked song each time you return to the crossroads.
Songs can also be marked as favorites, and the Music Maker instructed to only randomize from those.

The mod can also be configured to choose from all songs in the game, even those not yet unlocked/bought or discovered.

Will work with any songs added in the future, or through other mods.

## Configuration

By default, the mod will only randomize from unlocked songs.
You can change this behaviour by setting the `allSongs` option to `true`.
**Spoiler Warning**: Note that this will include songs that are not yet unlocked in the game, e.g. from future regions or bosses.

To disable the mod through the config, simply set `enabled` to `false`.
