# Randomize Music Maker Song Choice

This mod adds a new song to the Music Maker, which will play a random available song each time you return to the crossroads.
Can be configured to choose from all songs in the game, even those not yet unlocked/bought or discovered.

Will work with any songs added in the future.

## Configuration

By default, the mod will only randomize from unlocked songs. You can change this behaviour by setting the `allSongs` option to `true`.
**Spoiler Warning**: Note that this will include songs that are not yet unlocked in the game, e.g. from future regions or bosses.

To disable the mod through the config, simply set `enabled` to `false`.
