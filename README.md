# Favorite Songs

This mod allows you to mark songs as favorites with the Music Maker, and randomize from those songs only - instead of all songs - after unlocking the incantation that allows randomizing songs.

Simply mark a song as favorite using the same button as for pinning incantations and recipes, and randomize from your favorites using the "Open Inventory" button.

Will work with any songs added in the future, or through other mods.
